        A complete beginner on the path to becoming a Frontend Engineer.

        have a well-structured path towards my goal. Eager to learn and grow,
        and excited to explore the world of frontend development and take on new

        <strong>Why I joined AltSchool Africa:</strong><br /><br />
        I got to know about AltSchool when I took part in an internship program
        at DevCareer Africa - which was partnered by AltSchool. It involved
        using part of the AltSchool curriculum to learn Frontend Engineering I
        enrolled in the AltSchool program afterwards, so that I will have access
        to a platform with a well-structured curriculum to learn what I need to
        excel as a Frontend Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My goal:</strong><br /><br />My ultimate goal with the AltSchool
        program is to acquire skills that would make me a renowned Frontend
        Engineer, and set me on the path of constant personal development and
        land a job with my skills. I also intend to use the knowledge acquired
        from this program to contribute to the integration of tech into
        healthcare.
